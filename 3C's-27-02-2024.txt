Card: This refers to the user story or requirement written on a physical or digital card.
 The card contains information about what needs to be done, who it's for, and why it's important.

Conversation: This emphasizes the importance of face-to-face communication and collaboration within the team. 
Instead of relying solely on documentation, Agile encourages team members to have conversations to clarify requirements
, discuss solutions, and ensure everyone has a shared understanding of the work.

Confirmation: This involves creating acceptance criteria or tests that need to be met for a user story to be considered complete. 
By defining clear criteria upfront, the team can ensure that the work meets the customer's expectations and fulfills the intended purpose.

These 3C's help teams streamline their processes, improve communication, and deliver 
value to customers in a more efficient and effective manner within the Agile framework.
